#summary How to ignore or exclude properties from being serialized

= Introduction =

Occasionally you don't want certain properties to be serialized on your objects.  Any property that does not have both a getter and a setter is ignored by default.  For your other properties and public fields there are several ways of excluding them from serialization.


= [JsonExIgnore] =

The first way is to attach the JsonExIgnore attribute to your property or field.

{{{
public class MyClass {

   [JsonExIgnore]
   public int MyProperty {
     get { return _myProperty; }
     set { _myProperty = value; }
   }
}

}}}

= SerializationContext = 

If you don't or can't modify your class, you can also ignore properties through the Serialization context.

{{{
   Serializer serializer = new Serializer(typeof(MyClass));
   serializer.Context.IgnoreProperty(typeof(MyClass), "MyProperty");
}}}

= Config file =

The final way is through the app.config file.

{{{

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
  <configSections>
    <section name="JsonExSerializer" type="JsonExSerializer.XmlConfigSection, JsonExSerializer"/>
  </configSections>
  <JsonExSerializer>
    <IgnoreProperties>
      <add type="JsonExSerializerTests.Mocks.MyLine, JsonExSerializerTests" property="Start" />
      <add type="JsonExSerializerTests.Mocks.MyLine, JsonExSerializerTests" property="End" />
    </IgnoreProperties>
  </JsonExSerializer>
</configuration>
