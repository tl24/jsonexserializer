#summary Actions for Missing Properties (since 3.1)

When your Json text contains properties that do not exist on your class, you can set the MissingPropertyAction to determine how to handle this.

The code for that is
{{{
  Serializer s = new Serializer(typeof(MyClass));
  s.Config.MissingPropertyAction = MissingPropertyOptions.Ignore;
}}}

Here is an example to demonstrate:
*Class object*
{{{
public class Foo {
   public int ID;
}
}}}
*Json Text*
{{{
{
   ID: 1,
   Balance: 10.00
}
}}}

In this situation, the Balance property in the Json text does not exist on the Foo class.

== Ignore ==

This is the default option, missing properties are ignored.

== ThrowException ==

With this option if a missing property is encountered an exception is thrown.
